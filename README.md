## About

This repository contains my ESPHome project configurations designed to bridge the gap between controlling home devices, having an AI assistant, and being able to control my home via dedicated devices. ESPHome provides the perfect foundation for creating custom smart home solutions that integrate seamlessly with Home Assistant while maintaining local control and privacy.

## Why ESPHome?

ESPHome is a powerful system for creating custom firmware for ESP8266/ESP32 devices that:

- **Bridges Multiple Control Methods**: Connect traditional home devices with modern voice assistants and dedicated control interfaces
- **Local Control**: Keeps your smart home functioning without cloud dependencies
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Native integration with Home Assistant for seamless automation
- **Voice Assistant Support**: Built-in support for wake word detection and voice control
- **Customizable**: Full control over every aspect of your device's behavior
- **Open Source**: Community-driven with extensive documentation and support

## Split Preparation

This repository is prepared for splitting into two dedicated repositories:

- `esphome-smart-box-v1` (content from `esp32-p4-86-panel/`)
- `esphome-orbware-v1` (content from `xiaozhi-ball-v2/`)

### Post-split checklist

1. Move each device folder to its new repository root.
2. Keep each `resources/` folder in the same relative location used by its YAML.
3. Update only the `assets_base_url` substitution in each YAML file to the new repository URL.
4. Keep `README.md` and `HA_CONFIGURATION.md` together with their corresponding YAML configs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Home Assistant** - Running instance on your network
2. **ESPHome** - Installed as a Home Assistant add-on or standalone
3. **Compatible Hardware** - See individual project requirements
4. **2.4GHz WiFi** - ESP devices require 2.4GHz networks

### Installation

Each project has its own detailed installation guide. Navigate to the project directory and follow the README instructions:

1. Clone this repository or download the project files
2. Configure entity IDs and settings in the YAML file
3. Set up your WiFi credentials in `secrets.yaml`
4. Flash the firmware using ESPHome
5. Configure required Home Assistant sensors (see project's HA_CONFIGURATION.md if available)

## Current Focus

I am currently working with two smart display devices:

### ESP32-P4 Smart 86-Box / ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4B
A wall-mounted control panel compatible with multiple ESP32-P4 based devices:
- **Supported devices**: ESP32-P4-86-Panel-ETH-2RO, ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4B
- High-resolution 720x720 MIPI-DSI display
- Voice assistant with on-device wake word detection
- Weather dashboard with multi-day forecasts
- Media player controls with album art
- Home automation control buttons

### Xiaozhi Ball V2
A compact smart display that combines:
- Voice assistant capabilities
- Touch-enabled circular display
- Home automation control
- Media playback interface
- Real-time information display

These devices exemplify how ESPHome can transform hardware into versatile smart home control hubs that work seamlessly with AI assistants while maintaining full local control.

## Future Projects

This repository will grow to include additional ESPHome configurations for:
- Other smart display devices
