## About

This repository contains my ESPHome project configurations designed to bridge the gap between controlling home devices, having an AI assistant, and being able to control my home via dedicated devices. ESPHome provides the perfect foundation for creating custom smart home solutions that integrate seamlessly with Home Assistant while maintaining local control and privacy.

## Why ESPHome?

ESPHome is a powerful system for creating custom firmware for ESP8266/ESP32 devices that:

- **Bridges Multiple Control Methods**: Connect traditional home devices with modern voice assistants and dedicated control interfaces
- **Local Control**: Keeps your smart home functioning without cloud dependencies
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Native integration with Home Assistant for seamless automation
- **Voice Assistant Support**: Built-in support for wake word detection and voice control
- **Customizable**: Full control over every aspect of your device's behavior
- **Open Source**: Community-driven with extensive documentation and support
